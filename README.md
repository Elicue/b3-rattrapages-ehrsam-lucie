### Projects

- 02–Architecture : Npm Package Project

Library to get a random character from Harry Potter within selected filter criterias

- 06-Devops : 

Web application using Laravel and VueJS, that allows users to list all distributors installed by Picard and add new ones through a form. 
The application is Dockerized, includes a database, and supports easy initial data import via a volume.
I have used a Dockerfile and Docker Compose to orchestrate the application and its database.
